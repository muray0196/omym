# Project Rules:
1. All code and documentation must be written in English.
2. Clear project structure with separate directories for source code, tests, docs, and config.
3. All config/data must reside under the repository root (portable).
4. Do not retain any backward-compatibility layers—remove legacy paths immediately, update tests and docs together, and have console scripts point only to the canonical entry.
5. Do not Install/uninstall dependencies.
6. Use **basedpyright** for type checking.
```terminal
uv run basedpyright
```
7. Use **pytest** for testing.
```terminal
uv run pytest <test_target>
```
# Serena Usage (when available)
1. Perform Serena MCP Server initialization at project start.
2. Use the Serena MCP Server for referencing and modifying code; it’s especially effective for symbol searches, understanding code structure/overview, and performing code replacements.
3. Manage memories as long-lived project knowledge
# Coding Rules:
1. Use a feature-oriented hexagonal structure: each feature owns domain, usecases, adapters modules; cross-cutting utilities live in platform/ or shared/.
2. Configuration management using environment variables.
3. Use @dataclass for plain data containers only
5. Use the standard 'logging' module.
6. Use type hints in all functions, methods, and variable declarations.
- Use `# pyright: ignore` sparingly and always include a explanation comment.
7. Detailed documentation using docstrings.
- Follow the Google style for docstring conventions.
- Frequently update existing docstrings where necessary.
8. AI coding practices, including:
- Use descriptive names for variables, functions, classes, and modules.
- Provide comments for complex or non-obvious logic.
- Handle exceptions gracefully, with clear, informative error messages.
# Testing Rules:
1. Place all tests in `./tests`.
2. Write tests exclusively using pytest and pytest-mock.
3. Complex tests must have a simple docstring describing their purpose.
